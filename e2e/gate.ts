/**
 * Shared machinery for the WCAG gate.
 *
 * Five rules govern everything here, and each one corrects something the gate
 * this replaces did:
 *
 *  1. NOTHING IS INJECTED INTO THE PAGE BEFORE A SCAN. The old spec pushed
 *     `animation:none!important; transition:none!important` through
 *     `addStyleTag`. That BYPASSES this lab's own
 *     `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` block instead of exercising it,
 *     so the one rendering a reduced-motion reader actually gets — the
 *     stepper marker and the ledger bars with their transitions cancelled by
 *     the stylesheet's own rule — was never once the rendering that got
 *     scanned. This gate sets the
 *     preference through `emulateMedia`, asserts from inside the page that it
 *     took effect (`test.use({ reducedMotion })` silently does nothing on
 *     Playwright 1.61.1), and injects nothing.
 *
 *  2. IT FORCED EVERY PANEL VISIBLE FROM SCRIPT. The old drive stripped every
 *     `[hidden]` attribute and set every `<details>.open` by JS before its only
 *     scan. Stripping `hidden` puts all six tabpanels on screen AT ONCE — a
 *     rendering no reader can reach and axe then scans instead of the real one
 *     — and script-opening the disclosures means the SHUT state, which is what
 *     every reader arrives at, was never scanned at all. This gate switches
 *     tabs by clicking them and opens each disclosure through its `<summary>`,
 *     which is the route a reader has, and scans before and after.
 *
 *  3. IT DROVE BLIND AND THEN THREW THE STATES AWAY. The old drive clicked
 *     every button whose label matched a regex, swallowed every failure with
 *     `.catch(() => {})`, waited a fixed 120ms per tab, and scanned ONCE at the
 *     end — so the invalid-key rendering, the malformed-hex branch, the
 *     rejected-preset pipeline and the stepper's intermediate reveals were all
 *     overwritten before anything measured them, and a click that silently did
 *     nothing looked identical to one that worked. This drive names every
 *     control it touches, asserts a real completion signal after each, and
 *     scans after every step, in {dark, light} x {1280, 380}.
 *
 *  4. `violations` IS NOT THE WHOLE ORACLE. See `scan`. The surfaces that carry
 *     this lab's meaning — every `.verdict` tone, every `.badge`, the
 *     `.verdict` tones, every `.badge`, the `.cl-hero-why` box and the shared
 *     top bar's ink — are all `color-mix()` fills axe files under `incomplete`
 *     rather than judging. So is an `aria-label` on a role-less element, which
 *     is how this lab's `<p id="loop-bits">` was caught.
 *
 *  5. IT HAD NO REFLOW, NON-TEXT-CONTRAST OR GENERATED-CONTENT ORACLE. The old
 *     spec hand-rolled one luminance check over two input selectors, reading
 *     the DECLARED `border-top-color` and `background-color` — blind to
 *     `color-mix()`, to composited backdrops, to every `.btn`, `.tab-btn`,
 *     `<select>` and `<input>`, and to all states past first paint.
 *     `nontext.ts` replaces it with a measured oracle over every control at
 *     every driven state, and `expectNoHorizontalOverflow` adds the 1.4.10
 *     check axe has no rule for.
 */

/**
 * Wait for every running animation and transition to drain.
 *
 * Two rAFs are not enough. A transition sampled mid-flight has a colour that
 * exists in no state of the page, and axe will happily report it: elsewhere in
 * this fleet that produced a phantom 2.00:1 failure on a button whose settled

 * poll for "nothing running right now" can exit through a gap between waves —
 * hence six consecutive quiet frames rather than one.
 *
 * Bounded three ways, because a gate that can hang is a gate nobody runs:
 * animations that never finish (`iterations: Infinity`) are excluded from the
 * quiescence test rather than waited on, a wall-clock budget inside the page
 * gives up and proceeds, and Playwright's own timeout is the backstop.
 *
 * Under the reduced motion this gate asserts, `style.css`'s reduced-motion
 * block cancels every transition this lab declares, so
 * `getAnimations()` is normally empty and this returns on the sixth frame. It
 * stays because the shared top bar's `.cl-btn` transitions are declared
 * OUTSIDE the lab's `@media` block — `* { transition: none !important }` wins

 *    best-practice rules `withTags` does not run on its own.
 *  - `incomplete` — axe's "could not decide" bucket, which never reaches the
 *    violations array. The one rule id allowed to remain incomplete is
 *    `color-contrast`, and only because the next assertion computes those
 *    ratios arithmetically — which matters here because the surfaces carrying
 *    this lab's meaning are `color-mix()` fills axe cannot resolve: all four
 *    verdict tones, every provenance and status badge, the hero aside and the
 *    shared bar's ink. Everything else in that bucket is a real result axe

 *    where an `aria-label` on a role-less element hides. That is not
 *    hypothetical here: this lab shipped exactly one, an `aria-label` on the
 *    `<p id="loop-bits">` bit strip, and the `incomplete` assertion is the
 *    only thing that ever reported it.
 *  - arithmetic contrast — composite-aware WCAG 1.4.3 over every text node.
 *  - the same walk over `aria-hidden` content with the exemption lifted —
 *    SC 1.4.3 is about what a reader SEES; see `contrast.ts` for what this
 *    lab hides and why it is measured anyway.
 *  - non-text contrast and generated content — SC 1.4.11, ratcheted; see
 *    `expectNoNewNonTextFailures`. This is the only oracle that judges a
 *    control's boundary against the surface OUTSIDE it.
 *  - keyboard reachability of scrolling regions — WCAG 2.1.1.
 *  - no focusable element that paints nothing — WCAG 2.4.3/2.4.7.
 *  - reflow — WCAG 1.4.10, which axe has no rule for at all.

 *    every disclosure shut.
 *
 *  - EVERY PANEL IS RENDERED LAZILY, so a tab that is never clicked is a
 *    panel that is never even in the DOM. Each of the six is activated through
 *    its real tab button and scanned in its own driven states.
 *
 *  - THE WARNING AND FAILURE STATES ARE THE POINT OF THIS LAB, so they are
 *    scanned rather than assumed: the tool's refusal on the below-minimum
 *    fixture, the "assessment not run" state a modified file produces, the
 *    empty-file error, a cancelled analysis, the pad-too-short failure, and
 *    the three verdicts that read as success and failure at once. Those tones
 *    (warn, bad) are painted on fills this gate has otherwise never measured.
 *
 *  - HOVER IS A STATE, AND IT PERSISTS AFTER A CLICK. `:hover` stays on the
 *    element under the pointer after `page.click()` resolves, so it is the
 *    state a reader occupies the instant after pressing a button — and
 *    `.tab-btn:hover`, `.btn:hover` and `.cl-btn:hover` all repaint their
 *    fill.
 *
 *  - NO FIXED TIMEOUTS. Every wait is on a real DOM completion signal: a
 *    verdict appearing, a table rendering, `aria-selected`, the worker's
 *    progress row going away.
